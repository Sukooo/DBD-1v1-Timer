A baisc timer application made for dead by daylight but really can be used anywhere.

Comes with one simple small window with 2 timer slots on it.

To target timer 1 press F1, to target timer 2 press F2.

To start the timer - Press ctrl + f or shift + f. Doesn't require the window to be focused.

The window is draggable and will show above any other window that isn't set to be the top window.

Created in c++ using WINAPI and D2D1 and DWRITE libraries for graphics and writing.
