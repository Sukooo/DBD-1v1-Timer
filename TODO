add:
- Make milliseconds text smaller
- Add controller support.
- Add ability to bind mouse buttons (mwheel, mbuttons, etc..)
- Add option to start a timer directly with a bind.
- Implement state machine pattern for app state.

fix:
- keyboard hook should queue a message when a hotkey is hit, mainwindow should catch that message and handle it. (currently keyboardhook directly calls a mainwindow method).
